          As a passionate Software Engineer, I thrive in web development and
          have a strong affinity for UI/UX Design. My eagerness to learn and

          As a specialist in bridging brand identity through the fusion of Web
          Development and UX/UI, I craft innovative and impactful design
          solutions for the modern era. Beyond work, I find joy in playing
          volleyball and exploring different places through travel. In my
          leisure time, I indulge in watching anime and count myself as a big
          fan of the TV series "Friends."
