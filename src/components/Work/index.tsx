            <p>
              I worked with abdelouadoud in several projects, he feels like an
              extension of our team. When a project comes up, he is super
              responsive, professional, and just fun to work with. Iâ€™m always
              amazed at how he manages to take our rough vision and make
              something beautiful. He makes us look good! Abdelouadoud is also
              skilled at understanding the business case, setting expectations,
              and very patiently managing any edits. He has a true eye for
              design and ensures everything fits within our brand. Iâ€™ve
              recommended him to many others!
